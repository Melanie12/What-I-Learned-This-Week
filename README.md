# Weekly Learnings Tracker

I am currently learning several different things, including Japanese, chess, maths, and Python.

## School Year Classes

- 2 hours of Japanese every Monday
- 1 hour and 30 minutes of chess class every Saturday at my local club

## Other Classes

- One hour of math every week with a [teacher](https://www.maprofdemaths.com/)
- Self-learning Python programming with the help of my [mentor](https://github.com/Master-Touks)
- Saturday morning, I attend Arduino workshops where we build Arduino projects and learn about electronics.
- Various other online self-paced classes

Professionally, I was working for a company in the field of machine learning, where I had no prior knowledge about ML and learned a ton from the team. Although I left that company, I still try to improve my technical knowledge about ML topics.

There are many topics I want to learn in the future, and I could start plenty of other hobbies. However, my hypercuriosity can sometimes lead to distractions and cause me to lose track of what I want to learn.

I primarily document my learnings on my [blog](https://melanie-almeida.com/), but so far, it has been mostly long-form content. This repository aims to track everything I learn in a week, organized by topic. I will also share resources, blog articles, and books I am reading.
