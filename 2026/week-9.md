# Week 9

## Maths

I’m studying the module on derivatives.

## Python

I completed the Python Basics course from the freeCodeCamp certification.

## Chess

I played in a chess tournament last Saturday and won three out of seven games. I’m pleased with the result, especially since it was my first time playing 10‑minute games.

I also won a game using the Tuxler counter‑attack that I learned the previous week.

This week I’m attending a chess boot camp every evening.

## Japanese

I missed class because I had too much freelance work.

## Hardware

There was no Arduino workshop this week due to school holidays, but I’ll work on my first Raspberry Pi project this weekend.

## Books

I’ve started reading Grokking Algorithms again.
