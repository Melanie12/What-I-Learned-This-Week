# Week 8

## Maths

## Python

## Chess
This week, I am focusing on learning the Traxlet counter attacke and the Caro Khan opening.

## Japanese

## Hardware
At the last Arduino workshop, we discovered and learned what is an [Electronic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator). I didn't understand everything at once, so I'll create to myself an Obscidian page to understand how it works.
