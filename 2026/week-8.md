# Week 8

## Maths
No class that week.

## Python
I have completed the book "How to get Programming with Python". 
I have dropped the past curriculum of FreeCodecamp to move to the current updated one.

## Chess
This week, I am focusing on learning the Traxler counter-attack and the Caro Kann opening.


## Japanese
We learned about intransitive verbs.

## Hardware
At the last Arduino workshop, we discovered and learned what is an [Electronic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator). I didn't understand everything at once, so I'll create to myself an Obscidian page to understand how it works.


## Books
Currently finishing to read some fiction before moving back to non-fiction.
