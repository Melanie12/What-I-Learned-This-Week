# Week 36

I was off for the holidays. I am taking some time to get back on track.

## Maths

We finished the chapter on polynomial functions and quadratic equations.
I have completed a lot of exercices to review past lessons, but I rushed them to finish before my lesson.
I'll change my approach to do one exercice daily.


## Python

Completed Unit 5 of the book "[Get Programming with Python](https://github.com/Melanie12/Get-programming-learn-to-code-with-python-book)".
I also started again FreeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python".

## Chess

Started a new deferred game. But the break playing chess was too long. I need to play more games and start reading my chess books.

## Japanese

My japanese classes start back on september 29th, so I am reviewing last year's chapters.
