# Week 32

I started this file on Thursday, August 7th, so it's still incomplete.

## Maths

I learned about polynomial functions.

I won't have classes the next two Fridays, so I'll complete the exercises given by my teacher.

## Python

I'm completing Unit 5 of the book "[Get Programming with Python](https://github.com/Melanie12/Get-programming-learn-to-code-with-python-book)".

## Chess

I abandoned a deferred game I was playing for a few days because I didn't have enough material to continue.

In the next few weeks, I'll play fewer games but focus on improving my tactics knowledge and reading the books recommended by our teacher.

## Miscellaneous

I also installed GrapheneOS on my phone on Sunday. I want to learn more about its usage, F-Droid, and how to keep degoogling.

I'm upset that I had to use Google Play Services with my account to download apps. I'll look into other ways to install apps without relying on Google.
