# Week 41

Back on track, to maintain a weekly habit.

## Maths
We finished the chapter about Math's logic. It was interesting and it will be helpful for when I will learn about algorithms.


## Python

Almost complted Unit 6 of the book "[Get Programming with Python](https://github.com/Melanie12/Get-programming-learn-to-code-with-python-book)".
That unit is longer than previous ones. It's about mutable and immutable objects. I aiming to complete the unit this week including the capstone project.

## Chess
We learned about the Scoth's Gambit and playing pawn's finale. I need to practice these a bit more.
I have also started reading Tartakover's book.
